================

NICAR 2015 class to introduce reporters to the power of the terminal. Nothing fancy, just the fundamentals. Contributions welcome! Share your knowledge

This is designed to be Part 2 of a beginners' class: lightly touching on the basics and then getting into more interesting tools (fetching from the web, intermediate data wrangling, etc.)

Possible areas this course will cover:

Reviewing the basics:

-Navigation (cd = changing directories, ls = listing files/folders, pwd = print working directory, ctrl + a = move to beginning of line, ctrl + e = move to end of line, ctrl + c = stop process, ps -x = detailed list or processes running)

-Basic data wrangling (head = looking at the first few rows of a spreadsheet, exporting the first few rows of a big spreadsheet, wc -l = counting the total number of rows) and file inspection (vim, egrep, uniq)

Intermediate stuff: 

-Fetch things from the interwebs (wget, cURL)

-Intermediate data wrangling (csvkit, sqlite from commandline)

And an important P.S.:

Why you need to learn Git:
-Chapters 1-3 will give you a good, relatively quick overview:
